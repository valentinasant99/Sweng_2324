Compiling module com.example.sweng.Storia2024
   Unification traversed 1111 fields and methods and 585 types. 5 are considered part of the current module and 13 had all of their fields and methods traversed.
   [WARN] Some stale types ([com.example.sweng.client.WritePage$1]) were not reprocessed as was expected. This is either a compiler bug or a Generator has legitimately stopped creating these types.
